description: 3D perception costmap representation for highly dynamic environments. Uses novel data structured from Dreamworks animations applied to robotics for this real-time obstacle representation method. It is designed for robots processing multiple high-resolution sensors and substantially reduces resources compared to other state of the art solutions.
