### Why Join?

Joining the Open Navigation Foundation is one of the best ways to helping drive the development and support of open-source robotics capabilities, beyond creating and sharing them yourself. While other organizations like Open Robotics focuses on robotics infrastructure and community organization, we focus on the community of mobile robotics and its surrounding projects. Promoting navigation technologies will push the state of the art, increase capabilities for commercial use, and produce high-quality documentation to help train and funnel talent to your organization.

By supporting the Open Navigation Foundation, you're supporting the creation, development, and long-term maintenance of capabilities like:

- Sensor drivers
- Mapping and Localization Techniques
- Planning
- Control
- Navigation
- Manipulation
- Environmental Representation
- Perception
- Image, Depth, and Aata Processing (algorithmic and AI)
- Robot Applications
- Sensor Fusion
- ROS and ROS2

By joining Open Navigation, your company will be a member of the Navigation Technical Steering Committee (TSC). This TSC will steer and oversee technical development, creating cost-shared capabilities. Members will be featured prominently in projects, media interviews, and at events.

Additional membership perks include:

- Discounted rates on services 
- Free access to events
- Networking and business opportunities
- Exclusive quaterly reports highlighting progress and emerging trends
- Support from Foundation engineers
- Ability to start new projects and collaborate with industry leaders
